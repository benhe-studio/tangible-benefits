> F = m * a

Newton was pretty clear on this one. More weight requires more force to move (and more force to stop).

The mice industry recently hopped on the ultralight trend with [perforated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypophobia) shells. I think this was huge step forward towards the ultimate goal of *effortless* glide (even moreso than going wireless). The lack of inertia results in a level of control that cannot be replicated by any other means.

Wireless headphones on the other hand, didn't seem to get the memo.

In this case, additional weight doesn't just increase headband pressure, it also results in tighter clamp on the ear cups to maintain stability. All the fancy mesh and foam can only go so far to conceal this added force. When fatigue sets in after a brief wear, what good is the double digit battery life?

For objects that are required to move around, weight matters.
