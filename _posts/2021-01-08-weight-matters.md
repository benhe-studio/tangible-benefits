> F = m * a

Newton was pretty clear on this one. More weight requires more force to move (and more force to stop).

The mice industry recently hopped on the ultralight trend with [perforated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypophobia) shells. I think this was huge step forward towards the goal of *effortless* glide (even moreso than going wireless). The lack of inertia results in a level of control that cannot be replicated by any other means.

Unfortunately, the wireless headphone industry seem to be regressing in this domain.

Headphone | Weight
----------|-------------------
Bose QC35 (2016) | 235 g
Bose 700 (2019) | 254 g
Sony WH-1000XM4 (2020) | 254 g
B&O Beoplay H95 (2020) | 323 g
Apple AirPods Max (2020) | 385 g

Additional weight on a headphone doesn't just increase headband pressure, it also requires tighter clamp on the ear cups to maintain stability. All the fancy mesh and foam can only go so far to conceal this added force. When fatigue sets in after a brief wear, what good is the double digit battery life?

An effortless experience is the ultimate expression of luxury, not an all-metal construction. For gadgets that are designed to be moved or worn, weight matters.
