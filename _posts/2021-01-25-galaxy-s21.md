The Galaxy S21 is Samsung's attempt to reposition the base product line as its mainstream offering, distancing it from the flagship Ultra line. To create this transition, Samsung makes a number of meaningful trade-offs to deliver a well rounded hardware package for the $800 ($200 less than the S20).

**Design**

While previous iterations of the Galaxy camera bump looked like an incidental afterthought, the S21 integrates its camera system with the frame to form one contiguous element. This makes the design appear much more cohesive and intentional.

**Trade-offs**

Samsung found some clever places to cut cost without resulting in compete regressions from a user experience perspective.

- The plastic back casing is arguably less premium than glass, but it does offer weight and durability benefits.
- The switch from a 1440p display to 1080p provides better performance and battery, while still keeping a relatively high 421 DPI.

Out of the remaining changes from the S20, the SoC update is the most substantial. I am glad that Samsung did not compromise here in the same way that Google did with the Pixel 5. By sticking to a flagship SoC, the Galaxy S21 guarantees the best case scenario regarding performance longevity and software support over the lifespan of the phone.
