title:  "Downfall of AV Receivers"
---

AV receivers are relatively simple devices: an audio/video switch with a surround sound amplifier built in. They were brought to market to solve a few clear shortcomings of TVs at the time.

- Limited input ports. Switching between multiple sources required physically swapping cables.
- Lack of integrated hardware to drive surround sound speaker systems.

Over the 2000s and most of the 2010s, AV receivers were firmly entrenched as the central hub of a home theater system.

During the same period, TV manufacturers relentlessly expanded the TV's built-in capabilities in an effort to add more value versus the competition. Multiple inputs, internet connectivity, streaming applications, and signal processing quickly became standard even on budget offerings.

To provide a complete audio solution, the same manufacturers developed surround sound systems based on the sleek sound-bar form factor. They focused on making these systems cheap, simple to set up, and easy to use. Despite the weaknesses in performance and expandability, sound-bars quickly dominated the consumer market due to their cost and simplicity.

With these new developments, AV receivers are now rapidly becoming a niche product. The target demographic is limited to enthusiasts who want to build a discrete sound system piece by piece, or installers that require the full IO flexibility that a receiver offers. Even for these users, many of the receiver's features are now a liability rather than an asset.

Over the past decade, receiver manufacturers focused solely on checking off features, cramming in every possible input, output, and option into their devices. The companies lost sight of the user's problems and needs, and had no vision for how an AV experience should work.

There is a cost to all of the redundant and obsolete hardware that will never be used. And even if the hardware itself was free, the complexity exists at the expense of user experience.
