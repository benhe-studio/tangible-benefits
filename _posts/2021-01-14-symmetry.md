Human body parts are [chiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality). Yet why do so many products have symmetrical designs?

Maybe the priority was to make a pretty promo image and optimize tooling efficiency, or maybe the designers just need some extra practice with [shape puzzles](https://www.amazon.com/Shape-Puzzle/s?k=Shape+Puzzle).

In any case, finding headphones with D-shaped earcups really shouldn't be any more difficult than buying left and right shoes.
