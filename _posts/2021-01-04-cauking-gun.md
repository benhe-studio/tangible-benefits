Caulking guns are a staple in every home owner's toolkit. The first time I used one was to replace the baseboards in my bathroom. I was pleasantly surprised by many aspects of its design, and I think itâ€™s a fantastic example of what makes a great product.

- Cheap - $10 at the local hardware store

- Simple - Intuitive to learn and use for someone with no experience

- Comprehensive - Includes all the features for common work flows: built-in tip cutter and seal punch

- Compatible - Works with all standard 10oz tubes regardless of brand or compound

- Durable - Robust mechanical design with no obvious failure points

I can think of very few products that are able to tick the same boxes.
