**Background**

Audio is a slow moving field. Transducer technology hasn't seen much change in a [century](https://patents.google.com/patent/US1707570), and great sounding hardware from decades ago is still competitive with products today. Innovation has mainly been focused on improving convenience, and with new technologies enabling true wireless headphones, the audio experience has taken another leap forward.

Unfortunately, these technologies are most often integrated into the headphone as a single non-serviceable device. This design limits the lifespan of the entire product to the lowest common denominator - the battery. Once the battery capacity inevitably decays, the entire device needs to be replaced. Manufacturers will gripe about physical constraints or reliability, but I think they just enjoy having the opportunity to sell you headphones every 3 years instead of 10.

Besides the obvious environmental impacts, this consumable approach is absurd for high end or professional equipment that have traditionally long lifespans. In the IEM space where many enthusiasts have committed to custom molded housings and where earphones can cost thousands of dollars, this type of integration isn't viable. The existence of a universal wireless adapter was inevitable.

The FiiO UTWS3 isn't the first bluetooth adapter to exist for IEMs, but it's one of the first to offer a user experience that meets the baseline set by the AirPods.

**Design**

The physical design of the adapter is reminiscent of an oversized hearing aid. The smooth plastic housing which contains the electronics is attached to a soft touch moldable ear hook. Despite their size, the adapters are light weight and very comfortable to wear. The housing makes little contact against my ears, and the IEMs themselves end up carrying most of the weight due to the stiffness of the ear hook. This indicates that the fit of your IEMs will directly impact your experience with the adapters. For me, they are stable enough for running, and comfortable enough to lay down against a pillow.

To accommodate a wide range of IEMs and the bulky adapters, the charging case has a substantial footprint. The size is much better suited for a bag rather than your pockets. The top cover is made from metal (which is a nice premium touch), and has an identical hinge/magnet design as the AirPods. The bottom shell is made from plastic and houses the magnetic cradle, batteries, pairing button, indicator LEDs, and the USBC charging port. I look forward to future generations of this product with a lower profile design, and a more portable case.

**Software**

Bluetooth pairing and playback with the iPhone 12 has been reliable, but the software experience is extremely immature. On my unit with shipping firmware, the volume automatically resets to maximum every time the device connects to bluetooth. This issue reportedly fixed on newer V0.2.46 firmware, but the OTA update process is only supported on Android. Sadly, the FiiO app fails to detect the UTWS3 on my Galaxy S9, and the Play Store reviews are flooded with the same complaint. I hope FiiO prioritizes software stability and is able to resolve these problems swiftly. 

**Sound**

Although the UTWS3 advertises significant noise floor improvements over the UTWS1, some static is still perceptible when no audio is playing. The noise is more apparent on the primary adapter side (in TWS mode), but it's not enough to be an annoyance. The overall sound quality is great with no noticeable distortion or weakness. 

**Conclusions**

With the UTWS3, FiiO delivers a comprehensive wireless solution at an acceptable price. Even though the software isn't ready for prime time and the hardware lacks refinement, this is a solid foundation for future products to improve on. In its current form, the UTWS3 gets the important features right, and tolerating the existing issues is a small price to pay for the joy of convenience.
