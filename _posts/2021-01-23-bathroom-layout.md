3 piece bathroom. 70" (W) * 100" (D) 

**Insights**

- Freestanding tubs should not double as a shower.

- Floating toilets allow continuous sightlines along the floor, making the room feel less cluttered.
 
- Built in niches are very functional and adds texture to a surface.

- Consolidating plumbing in one wall simplifies the mechanical design.
